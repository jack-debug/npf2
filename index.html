<h1><u>npf.2</u></h1>
<p>npf.2 is an updated version of <a href="https://github.com/jack-debug/npf/">npf</a>, a project I worked on in 2020.</p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>npf.2 is a packet flooder. It sends multiple packets of information to a specific IP Address in what is essentially a DOS attack.<br>It uses UDP as the network protocol to send packets.</P>
<h3>Improvements from npf</h3>
<p>npf.2 uses threads to increase the power of a packet flood. npf.2 also has better performance than npf and has been optimized and the code has been cleaned up.</p>
<p>If you want to try out npf.2, it is publically available on <a href="https://github.com/jack-debug/npf.2/">Github</a>.</p>
